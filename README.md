# GitHub Actions Hero

## FAQ

### Is this an official GitHub project?

No, it's a side-project I've been tinkering with.

### How does it work? Does it support all features of GitHub Actions?

No, this just emulates the workflow execution. Many features are supported, but not everything. And nothing is executed.

The tutorial has limited support for `echo` and outputting environment variables, but you cannot run actual commands.

## Structure

_Currently working on splitting this into separate components so that I can use it in https://github.com/cschleiden/vscode-github-actions_
